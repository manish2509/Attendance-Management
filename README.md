# Attendance-Management
Attendance Management System is a dynamic project developed for daily student attendance in college. If facilitates to access the attendance information of a particular student in a particular class. The information is sorted by the operators, which will be provided by the teacher for a particular class. This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. The student list is created in the beginning which can also be updated later. The daily attendance is entered for each student in the list and this information is stored in the database for future reference. To create this dynamic project I have used eclipse  as front end and Mysql query browser as the back end.
The purpose of developing attendance management system is to computerize the attendance process. Another purpose for developing this software is to generate the report automatically at the end of the session. It also facilitates the students to view their attendance percentage and their history of absent and on duty record. Thus there is a track of attendance visible to admin as well as student side.
